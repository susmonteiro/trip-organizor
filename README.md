**General idea:** We want to make an app that helps you visualize all the places you want to visit and helps you organize them easily. 

### First things first:
- create 2 views: one with a list of things and another with a map from google maps
- search-bar to add things to the table and maps
- possibility to remove things from the table + maps

### Layout: 
- left side: table with all of the places and the possibility to add them, edit them and remove them
- right side: map with a pin on all of these places

### Table columns:
- name of the place
- button to open on google maps
- type of activity (restaurant, sight seeing, museum and allow people to choose more)
- check
- favorite
- date
- delete button (hidden)

### Detailed View:
- everything on the table
- description
- show photos from the google api (for later)

### Main menu after login:
- show all of the trips
- possibility to hide those that are completed, which means, possibility to mark them completed

### Extreme cases:
- when typing something that doesn't exist, don't add it to the list

### Later on:
- click on the map and add a custom pin 
- click on one of the table entries and the right side is covered by a detailed description of the thing
